To manage the work,  MS Project will be used to schedule all the tasks like who does what, and how long it will be.  This part is about the functioning of the schedule
\newline
\newline

At the start of the project, we added on MS Project all the deadlines that are demanding by the bill of the project. This deadlines are the different reports (analysis, specifications, ..), the oral presentation and the rendering of the code of the project. After this, each week we decide the tasks we are going to work on for next week, then we add it on the planning and associated each one with the person who will do it.
\newline
\newline

For the moment we don't plan the coding part because until we have chosen all the technologies we will use, there are many tasks that we can't estimate the length. The only one we have done is to create a model of the game and its graphical interface to allow us to play the game. This will permit us to better understand the game and make easier the implementation of the artificial intelligence.
\newline
\newline

The second part plan is the UML modeling. During the preparation of the next report, we will dedicate one week to it, with the specifications that we will define it will allow us to plan almost completely the coding of our project.
\newline
\newline

Another important point is the sharing of our roles. For the moment we have define 3 specifics roles : 
\begin{itemize}
\item  Dan is the secretary. It means he has to organise the meetings and write their reports.
\item Gabriel is the master application, he has to the final decision about each point of the coding part.
\item Baptiste is in charge of the planning, he will set the deadlines of every tasks, and check if the deadlines are respected.
\end{itemize}
Moreover each people is archivist, all of us have to search the informations that we need to realize our software. Those who don't have a special role for the moment will be responsible of one of the next reports.
