Finally, our project is about creating an Artificial Intelligence able to compete with others computers or players.

Arimaa is a two player game. It has been designed to be difficult to foresee for computers, but easy to play for humans. 
In order to realize this project, the \emph{MonteCarlo Tree Search} algorithm will be used to decide what move to play according to its algorithm figures. Because of the high number of moves possible, it will need to choose to only develop some of them, that look most promising.
We already analysed the state of the art of \emph{Arimaa} and the \emph{Monte Carlo Tree Search}. Consequently, we will base our work on these theses, to best predict decisions, without doing again what has already been done.
We already know how to play this game, making it easier to create strategies for our Artificial Intelligence.

The point of this project is as well to test our program upon Grid5000, a network of multi-core machines. Then we will be able to compete with other computers, comparing algorithms and power of calculus.
