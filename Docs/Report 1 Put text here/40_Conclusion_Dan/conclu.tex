Finally, our project is about creating an Artificial Intelligence able to compete with others computers.

Arimaa is a two players game. It has been designed to be difficult to foresee for computers, but easy to play for humans. 
In order to realize our project, we will need some concepts and technologies. 
We will use the MonteCarlo Tree Research algorithm, to take the best decisions in our game. We will decide what move to play according to this algorithm figures. Because of the numerous moves possible, we will need to choose to develop some of the better ones, that will depend on the chosen parallelization tree. Any variation could totally change statistics.
We already analyse the state of the art of Arimaa and the MonteCarlo Tree Research. Consequently, we will base our work on these thesis, to best predict decisions, without doing what has already been done.
We already know how to play this game. So it would be easier to create strategies for our Artificial Intelligence.

The point of this project is as well to test our program upon Grid5000, a network of multi-core machines. Then we will be able to compete with other computers, comparing algorithms and power of calculus.
