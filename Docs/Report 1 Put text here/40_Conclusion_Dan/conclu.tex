Finally, our project is about creating an Artificial Intelligence able to beat an human playing the game \emph{Arimaa}.
\newline

\emph{Arimaa} is a two players game. It has been designed to be difficult to foresee for computers, but easy to play for humans. 
In order to realize our project, we will need some concepts and technologies. 
We will use the \emph{MonteCarlo Tree Search Algorithm} to take the best decisions in our game. We will decide what move to play according to its results. Because of the numerous moves possible, we will need to develop the better ones only, using parallelisation on different systems.
We already analyzed the state of the art of \emph{Arimaa} and the \emph{MonteCarlo Tree Search}. Consequently, we will base our work on these theses, to make it possible to use the best technologies with the best environment without doing again what has already been done.
We already know how to play this game, making it easier to create strategies for our Artificial Intelligence. We handle a task's schedule to control our work time ofr every aspect of the project, the point being mostly to learn how to schedule a project, foresee surprising events, and answer the demand.
\newline

The point of this project is also to test our program with Grid5000, a powerful network of multi-core machines. Then, we will be alble to use the full potential of our program in its maximal capacities, against a human.
