#Writing rules for reports

- Decide for a solid plan and contents before writing parts
- Use inputs to add documents, so everyone is working on his document, so not the same
- For pictures, create a folder img in each folder that contains all pictures of your subdocument
- Write folders names without spaces (using _ if necessary)
- Don't push on git code which is not compiling
- Don't use contractions in the report (isn't => is not)
- Don't use we, you in the report (exception : in the case we've done something, like studied something for the project). Use passive forms
- Agree on the vocabulary :
1. Monte Carlo Search Tree algorithm
2. MCTS algorithm
3. Monte Carlo
4. two-players
5. Minimax
