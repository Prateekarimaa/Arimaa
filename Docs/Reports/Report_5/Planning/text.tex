As stated in the third report, we used the agile methodology with iterations to implements our solutions. However some parts of the plannification went wrong. While we were ahead of schedule for two months, we relaxed and lost our advantage in time. We also didn't took in consideration the weeks spent on the preparation of the exams and theses ones, resulting into about one month delay.

Despite some memory leaks problem in January, the implementation of the parallelisation went smoothly. We also had time to improve the algorithm and to test different kind of implementations during the next two months.

From April, we started to work on the distribution of the algorithm on a cluster and the arimaa implemention. The later was far more complex than expected and too four times the estimated duration of the task. This was due to the use of bitboards to generate the moves.
