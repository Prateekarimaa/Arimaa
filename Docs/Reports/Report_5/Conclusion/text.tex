The project is developed and fully functional.Most of the modules have been implemented as per the plan.
A comparison is made between specification, design and implementation in comaprison to the initial conception during various phases.
Intially, the implementation was going ahead of our planning schedule by two weeks but due to some of the modules not planned properly and the optimisation not included into the  planning we lagged behind the planned schedule.Also,only one week was planned to take off from development forthe preparations of exam but due to work load at the studies it was increased to two weeks. A lot of optimisation has been done on MCTS in order to improve its implementaion with Arima.
Due to the lack of time, only some of the tests have been carried out succesfully by the time of this report submission.For example, CPU parallelisation,GUI for Arimaa, GUI for connect4, Convereter for Arimaa are some of the modules taht are tested and implented successfully.
