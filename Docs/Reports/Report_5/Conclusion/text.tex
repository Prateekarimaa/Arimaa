All the modules of the project are developed and are fully functional. Most of the modules have been implemented as per the plan.

A comparison is made between specification, design and implementation with the initial conception during various phases of the project.
Intially, the implementation was going ahead of our planning schedule by two weeks but due to some of the modules not planned properly as we underestimated the work load, we lagged behind. Also, only one week was planned to take off from development, for the preparations of exams but due to the work load of the studies it was increased to two weeks.

A lot of optimisation has been done on MCTS algorithm in order to improve its implementation with Arimaa. 

Due to the lack of time, only some of the tests have been carried out succesfully by the time of this report submission. For example, CPU parallelisation, GUI for Arimaa, GUI for connect4, Converter for Arimaa are some of the modules that are tested and implemented successfully.
