The focus of this report is related to designing of the software application.
The data structures that are used for the development of the MCTS algorithm application are finalised such as bit board and nodes. An attempt has been made to derive the association between the data structures, interfaces  and MCTS using the class diagram. 

The parallelization strategy that has been chosen is root parallelisation with MPI framework for clusters. The tree parallelization strategy has been chosen for implementation on the machine(computer) with  OpenMP framework. The testing of both the strategies has been done successfully.

A graphical user interface is designed and is demonstrated with the help of UML diagram and is divided into three parts as the user interface, the model and the SFML.

The development of this report will serve as a base support for the concrete development of the project.
