The base algorithm is an implementation of the MCTS algorithm. All the functions related to it are included in the mcts namespace. As a parameter, it takes the abstract class \textit{TheGame}, the position (\textit{Bitboard}) to start the search with and an object (\textit{MctsArg}) to set parameters to the MCTS algorithm: for example, the time to search, the depth of the tree; the number of simulations to run; and the number of nodes to create in the tree.
The following Class Diagram\ref{fig:MCTSClassDiagram} represents the links between the different kinds of objects.

The class Node represents the tree, it is stored as an array in the mcts object. A detailed implementation is provided in the Data Structure part\ref{sec:DS}.

The singleton \textit{Count} is used for the statistics (such as the number of leaves, nodes created, and the number of run). Whilst providing statistics it also makes sure that no  memory leaks are happening by counting creations and destructions of the main objects.

The figure\ref{fig:MCTSAlgorithm} below represents the order of calls for the main function and provides some details about the implementation.

\noindent
\textit{\textbf{explore}}: start the exploration of the tree.
\medskip\\
\textit{\textbf{UpdateNode}}: make sure the node has children and update its terminal value if required.
\medskip\\
\textit{\textbf{select\_child\_UCT}}: go through all the children of a node and return the one with the highest result at the UCT function (refer to the \textit{pre-analysis report, part 3.4.4}).
\medskip\\
\textit{\textbf{playRandom}}: start to run the random simulations and return the winner/tie.
\medskip\\
\textit{\textbf{update}}: update the node statistics and feed the result back to its parents.
\medskip\\
\textit{\textbf{forceSetUCT}}: In the event of a winning move, the uct value is set to 42 in order to make sure that each and every further exploration goes through that node, (all the values calculated by the UCT function are below 42).
\medskip\\
\textit{\textbf{feedbackWinningMove}}: feed the winning move back to its parent: one does not want to go to that position because it would be a winning strategy for the opponent.
\medskip\\
\textit{\textbf{updateLosingParent}}: in the event of all the siblings being a losing move, update its UCT value to winning strategy in order to propagate the results.
\medskip\\
\textit{\textbf{select\_child\_WR}}: return the child with the highest win rate.\\
