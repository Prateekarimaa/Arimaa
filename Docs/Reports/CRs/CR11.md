#Project Arimaa – CR11 : Wednesday, November, 26th
Presents : Everyone, with Christian Raymond and Nikos Parlavantzas
##Order of business :
1. CAF
2. General Architecture
3. Comments on the second report

##Information :
- We won't talk about CAF in the report, only actor model, because CAF is an implementation not compatible with our work.
- We need to correct teacher mistakes
- General Architecture : merge two first diagram, change representation of diagram to be more concise, put the API flowchart here, add a new graph describing it, change the name of API, it is a convertor between MCTS and the game application. Delete the part of explanation of API, look for the use of a convertor in our project. Add a part explaing the architecture of the MCTS/parallelization part with diagrams to describe.
