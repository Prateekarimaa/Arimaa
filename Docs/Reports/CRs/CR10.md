#Project Arimaa – CR10 : Wednesday, November, 19th
Presents : Everyone, with Christian Raymond
##Order of business :
1. Where to put Input/Output in the report
2. CAF
3. Comments on the second report
4. Picture flowchart of Prateek to improve
5. Writing rules

##Information :
- The part Input/Output was at the beginning destined to described a new system which makes it possible for two computers to communicate which each other. It has been reduced to a simple interface able to make play different kind of players (Human-ComputerMCTS-Bots...) We will add it in the User Interface (UI) part.
- CAF framework discussion. The version  Baptiste studied was only available on Linux, so we believe it didn't worth it. Wrong because CAF can work on a lot of different implementations. Caf can works on windows. We will add a paragraph in the report, we will talk about the actor model. CAF is an equivalent to the software MPI, OpenACC, and OpenMP. Baptiste will look for it.
- Reminder of writing rules. "We" can be use to describe the project generally only.
- Gabriel's ugly picture: The Figure 1 does not look like good (use case diagram), the style is bad. Gabriel will improve it.
- Remove Library C in OpenMP and C++11 language
- Change of the plan of the report : begin with parallelization strategy and then architecture (Dan)
- Create a paragraph describing all part of the structure, with big boxes and interfaceogies, comparison mikail parallelization)
- Gabriel missing part on UI.
- Benoit missing part on MCTS graphics and text
- Table of contents spaces to correct. If Gabriel wants, he can have a document automatically good. Otherwise, it will be the old manual method by Dan.
- Flowchart to improve by Prateek : create a png picture, place the text correctly, invert the yes and the no, check for spelling mistakes
- Branching Factor fight : problem of footnote or in the text because the question is "is it important enough to put it in the text ?" The answer is no.
- Update foreseen to Mikail documents to be complete
- Sending of the document to Nikos, who has already corrected the first part. Mr Raymond will do it for Friday evening. For the 23 of November, we will all complete our part, before the next correction of the teacher. Before wednesday evening, everything should be corrected, to send the real document the day after
