#Project Arimaa – CR15 : Wednesday, January, 28th
Presents : Gabriel, Prateek, Benoit, with Christian Raymond and Pascal Garcia
##Order of business :
1. MPI : what has been done ? (*Gabriel*)
2. CAF : what has been done ? (*Prateek*)
3. MCTS : new issues / improvements (*Benoît*)
6. HTML page : what has been done ? (*Benoît*)
4. Opengates on the 31st of January : advancement of the application (*Gabriel*)


##Parallelization strategies

- Between threads : tree parallelization with lock only on tree expansion
- Between computers : root parallelization + regular synchronisations of the trees

##MPI

Needs to be tested at the department

##CAF

Needs daministrator rights on Linux ?

##MCTS

Use atomic locks with OpenMP

##Opengates

Try to get a Windows room

#Report

New plan : 

1. Introduction  (Prateek)
2. Base algorithm (MCTS) (Benoît)
3. Data structure (Benoît)
  * Utilities and parameters (MctsArgs, Random, see src/tools/..)
  * Working data (Nodes, Tree pruning & Bitboards)
4. Parallelisation
  * Strategy  (Gabriel)
  * On computers (Benoît (OpenMP) + Prateek (CAF))
  * On clusters (Gabriel (MPI) + Prateek (CAF))
5. GUI  (Gabriel)
6. Conclusion  (Prateek)

##Next meeting : 02/04
Tasks :
- Benoît :
  * Continue working on the algorithm
  * Report first draft
  * Presentation for the opengates
- Prateek :
  * Report first draft
- Gabriel :
