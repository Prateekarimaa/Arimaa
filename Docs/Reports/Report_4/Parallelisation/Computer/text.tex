Given the size of the tree to be explored (at least \ensuremath{4 \times 10^8} nodes, see \ref{sec:DS}), a root parallelisation strategy within a machine can not be applied. A 11-million-nodes tree requires about 2 Gio of RAM. Should it be timed by 40 (\ensuremath{11 \times 10^6 \times 40 \approx 4 \times 10^8}), it would requires 80 Gio of RAM. Multiple threads, each working on seperate trees, would requires much more memory than there is available.

With this in mind, a tree parallelisation strategy has to be implemented on the computer. In this method, multiple threads share the same tree \ref{fig:TreeParallelization}, the exploration is done the same way as it is with one thread. The main problem is that multiple threads can access the same node and corrupt data given by another thread. To avoid such problems, we will be using \textit{virtual loss} and \textit{local mutexes}.

Should a thread go through a node, it automaticaly increases the value of its visit counter. This will virtually decrease the winning rate of the node and therefore decrease its attractiveness.

Each node also has a boolean to serve as a lock in order to prevent concurency. Its access is done in a critical section (atomic capture). Should a thread access a locked node, it will stop exploring and start its simulations.

This method of parallelization can be done by multithreading the \textit{While // loop simulations} described in the base algorithm implementation \ref{fig:MCTSAlgorithmOMP}. Using OpenMP, this is easily implented with a single \#pragma statement:\\
\textbf{\#pragma omp parallel shared(i,timeend)}\\
where \textit{i} (the number of simulation run), and \textit{timeend} (the time until simulations are to be run), are defined as shared variables. That way, we make sure that the time limit and total number of simulations are not overtaken. 

In order to prevent any conflict between threads, a small critical section has to control the lock of the nodes. Placing the following statement before \textit{node->getLock()} achieves this:\\
\textbf{\#pragma omp critical}
