\subsubsection{Human Resources}

Our project group is composed of six students, half of which will be abroad next semester.
That implies that most of the development phase will be carried out by a team of three people, with the help of the supervisors.
We also hope to get some advice from Mr Garcia, a researcher from the INSA who knows a lot about artificial intelligence.

\subsubsection{Other resources}

The algorithm is due to work on a set of clusters of multi-core machines.
\emph{Grid5000} is such a set, and we hope to get the authorization required use it to test our algorithm.
In the event that this authorization is denied, the algorithm will be tested at the computer science department of the INSA.

\subsubsection{Exterior knowledge}

The artificial intelligence (\emph{AI}) will implement the \emph{Monte Carlo Tree Search} (\emph{MCTS}), an algorithm that has been used in the past for board games.
The AI will be parallelized using the \emph{root parallelization} strategy, one of the main strategies used with the MCTS.

\subsubsection{Technologies used}

A few technologies will be used for this project :
\begin{itemize}
	\item The project will be coded in C++
	\item The application used as user interface uses SFML 1.6
	\item MPI, OpenMP and OpenAcc will be used for parallelization
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Important dates}

For this project, a number of set deadlines exist :
\begin{itemize}
	\item A conception report is due by the twelfth of February
	\item A HTML documentation is due by the twenty-fifth of March
	\item The final report  is due by the twenty-sixth of May
	\item A demonstration of the AI will take place on the twenty-sixth of May
	\item The application is to be finished and sent by the twenty-eighth of May
	\item A presentation of the project will take place on the twenty-eighth of May
\end{itemize}

In order to give us more time to work on the project, some time has been freed on our schedule, from May the eighteenth to May the twenty-eighth.
On the other hand, the exams that take place on the weeks of January the twelfth and May the eleventh have been considered as time off the project. 
Outside of these time period, the workload for each member of the team has been set to four hours a week, in order to increase our flexibility.
