\subsubsection{Human Resources}

Our project group is composed of six students, half of which will be abroad next semester.
That implies that most of the development phase will be carried out by a team of three people, with the help of the supervisors.
We also hope to get some advice from Mr Garcia, a researcher from the INSA who knows a lot about Artificial Intelligence.

\subsubsection{Other resources}

The algorithm is due to work on a set of clusters of multi-core machines. Then, we will test is on the computer of our INSA Computer Science department.
\emph{Grid'5000} is as well a set of clusters of multi-core machines, and we hope to get the time and the authorization required to use it to test our algorithm.

\subsubsection{Exterior knowledge}

The Artificial Intelligence (\emph{AI}) will implement the \emph{Monte Carlo Tree Search} (\emph{MCTS}), an algorithm that has been used in the past for board games.
The AI will be parallelized using the \emph{Root parallelization} strategy, one of the main strategies used with the MCTS algorithm.

\subsubsection{Technologies used}

A few technologies will be used for this project:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The project will be coded in C++ language
	\item The application used as user interface uses SFML 1.6
	\item MPI, OpenMP and OpenAcc will be used for parallelization
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Important dates}

For this project, a number of set deadlines exist:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A conception report is due by the 12$^{th}$  of February
	\item A HTML documentation is due by the 25$^{th}$ of March
	\item The final report  is due by the 26$^{th}$ of May
	\item A demonstration of the AI will take place on the 26$^{th}$ of May
	\item The application is to be finished and sent by the 2$^{th}$8 of May
	\item A presentation of the project will take place on the 28$^{th}$ of May
\end{itemize}

In order to give us more time to work on the project, some time has been freed on our schedule, from May the 18$^{th}$ to May the 28$^{th}$.
On the other hand, the exams that take place on the weeks of January the 12$^{th}$ and May the 11$^{th}$ have been considered as time off the project. 
Outside of these time periods, the workload for each member of the team has been set to 4 hours a week, in order to increase our flexibility.
