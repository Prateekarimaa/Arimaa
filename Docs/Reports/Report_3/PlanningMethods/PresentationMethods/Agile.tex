We are using for our project the Agile method and the Poker planification method.

The Agile method is a time bounded and iterative software development methodology for building and testing the software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to develop and test it all at once near the end.

To initiate the development of the project, each group member sits together and prepares a list of features they would like to see in their software.These things are called as user stories and they become the\emph{To Do} list of the project.Thereby using the Agile estimation techniques (such as Poker method),the stories are sized relatively to each other, by coming up with a guess as to how long will each user story take to complete. 

Before development, the tasks in the list that are to be done are prioritized  so that the most important stuff gets the highest priority and the least important one can be left for the last.
Then the development of the project starts with the initiation from top to bottom by building, iterating and getting feedback from the end user or the development team as the development proceeds.
