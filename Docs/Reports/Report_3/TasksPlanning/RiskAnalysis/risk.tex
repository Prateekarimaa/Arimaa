There will always be matters that will come up. The best way to find them is to think about what could go wrong in the Project.
Here is a list of sources that might possibly become cumbersome :
- getting used to the technology we will use (CAF, OpenMPI, OpenAcc, OpenMP, Boost Library...)
- booking the use of Grid5000, we don't know how long is the waiting list in order to be able to borrow it.
- Interoperability problems : most of us works on Windows Operating Systems. However Grid5000 runs on Linux, for this reason we will test our algorithm on a smaller scale. The computer science departement at INSA will be our first testing facility in order to make our cluster implemtation works.
- Lack of ressources : considering we will be only half of our crew on the second semester, the impact of a delay might be greater than expected.
