The input of our software will be the action of the users, his mouse clics, moves with keyboard. The Output will only be the display of the screen, after a move of the opponent in 1VSComputer or nothing in 1VS1.
To test our game, an interface will be implemented multiple times for diferent way of playing. This interface will define a serie of unique moves that will be used by all implementations to play. A first implementation has been done in the first application game, to make play two players against each other. The second implementation will be about 1VSComputer, linked with the MCTS algorithm. If another algorithm is willing to be tested, it will be added. Furthermore, if the time permits it, the management of computers bots (of the site arimaa.com) will be added. The only problem here is the computers bots are not similar to each others, thus it will take time to implement a class which will be able to communicate with both the computer bot and the interface.
