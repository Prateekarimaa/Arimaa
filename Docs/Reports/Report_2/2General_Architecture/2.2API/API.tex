This part is responsible for doing the interpretation between the two different modules i.e. the Model module and the MCTS Algorithm module, our AI . The Model and the AI are different modules. 

The output of AI will be utilised by the Model in order to make a move on the the board. It is possible that the output generated by the AI would be in the format that is not understandable by the application program. So there is a converter required to solve the purpose.

The converter will receive input from the MCTS algorithm module in some format such as tree and converts it into some other format that could be understood by the model such as a string or a binary code.
