This part is responsible for doing the interpratation between the two different modules i.e.the Application Program and the AI:MCTS Algorithm.The Application Program and the AI:MCTS Algorithm are two different modules.The output of  AI will be utilised by application program in order to make a move on the the board.It is possible that the output generated by the AI would be in the format that is not understandable by the application program.So there is a converter required to solve the purpose.The converter will receive input from the AI:MCTS algorithm in some format such as tree and converts it into some other format that could be understood by application program such as a string or a binary code. \ref{fig:flowchart}.
