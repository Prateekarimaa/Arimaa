\maketitle

The MCTS algorithm has been chosen in order to develop our artificial intelligence. However, in order to improve its efficiency, we will need to tweak it a bit. The main problem is the branching factor\footnote{In a tree,  the branching factor is the number of children at each node.} of the Arimaa game which average is 17 281 and reaches about 22 000 after 10 moves.

	\begin{tabular}{ | c | c |}
		\hline Game & Average number of possible moves \\ \hline
		\hline  
		Othello & 8\\
		\hline  
		Chess & 35\\
		\hline  
		Game of Go & 250\\
		\hline
		Arimaa & 17 281\\

	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\bigskip
The reason why the branching factor of a game is so important is because it increases greatly the space that has to be searched in order to guess what will happend multiples moves ahead. In chess after 6 moves, the number of positions evaluated are about 35\textsuperscript{6} which is roughtly equivalent to 1,8 billions. In Arimaa, after 3 turns (yours, the opponent and yours again), if you were the explore all positions, you would need to evaluate around 5,2 trillions\footnote{1 trillion = 1 thousand billions = 10\textsuperscript{12}.} boards (2000 times more than chess with half the number of moves).
