This second report is related to the incremental development of the project \textit{Fast and Furious Game Playing: Monte Carlo Drift}. It is about the specifications of the project.
This report focuses on "what" questions, such as what the algorithm will do, or what the application will do. It will describe each and every component of the project: the game, the general architecture, the Artificial Intelligence implementing the MCTS Algorithm,the Converter, the User Interface and the Application. A detailed focus is also made on the parallelisation techniques and the frameworks that might be used.
