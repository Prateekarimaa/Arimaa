The software specifications have been decided: further to the AI, a user interface (\emph{UI}) will be developed.
It will include every version of the AI that will have shown satisfying results.
Therefore, this project will be composed of three parts : the UI, the AI and the game model that will handle the rules.

The AI will use the \emph{Monte Carle Tree Search} algorithm.
In order to make it more efficient, it will implement parallelization on threads and on multiple machines.
Ultimately, the goal is to try and run our algorithm on \emph{Grid 5000}, a set of clusters of multi-core machines.
If the computers at our disposal have GPUs, they will also be used.
This parallelisation will be performed using OpenMP and OpenACC on every machine (OpenMP for thread parallelization and OpenAcc for GPU parallelization), and MPI between machines.
As for parallelization strategies, we will first use \emph{Root parallelization}, and then try other ones if there's enough time to do so.

The next step will be about defining the details of the implementation, before developement starts.
