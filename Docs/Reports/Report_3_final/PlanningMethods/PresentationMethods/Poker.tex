Planning poker is a consensus-based agile estimation technique. 
Planning Poker is very simple and effective. It is being utilised by the agile teams around the world to estimate their product backlogs. It can be used with story points, ideal days, working hours or any other estimating unit.

In planning poker, each individual in the team is asked to put an estimation about the tasks related to the project such as estimation about the consumption of time, or estimation about the resources required. Then keeping in mind the consensus, the most voted value or the value nearest to the most voted value about the task is chosen. The singular value are ignored.

Planning Poker reminds everybody that the estimate includes all of the work that needs to be accomplished in order for the story to be considered done. It includes development, testing, documentation, and anything else required for completion.
