In order to give us more time to work on the project, some time has been freed on our schedule, from May the 18$^{th}$ to May the 28$^{th}$.
On the other hand, the exams that take place on the weeks of January the 12$^{th}$ and May the 11$^{th}$ have been considered as time off the project. 
Outside of these time periods, the workload for each member of the team has been set to 4 hours a week, in order to increase our flexibility.
