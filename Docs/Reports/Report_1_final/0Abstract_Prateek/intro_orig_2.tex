This project is about inducing artificial intelligence for board games using the \emph{Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm} and is coined as \emph{Fast \& Furious Game Playing ,Monte Carlo Drift}. The board game chosen for this project is \emph{Arimaa}.
\newline

\emph{Arima} was conceived and developed by Umar Syed, a computer science engineer in 2003. It was intentionnaly made difficult for computers to play, whie keeping simple rules.The first program that can beat a human player in a game of 6 or more matches is entitled to win a prize of 10000 USD, given by Umar Syed.
\newline

A revolution in scheduling algorithms originated in the \emph{Monte Carlo Tree search Algorithm} (\emph{MCTS}). In this project, the techniques of the \emph{MCTS} algorithm are utilized to find what move to make. \emph{MCTS} is a heuristic search algorithm used for making decisions. It concentrates on analyzing the optimum moves by expansion of a search tree of random samplings called the search space.
\newline

The program will be implemented using parallelisation techniques to be able to run on different systems simultaneously .Eventually, the program will be executed on grid 5000, a cluster of multi core machines.
