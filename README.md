#Project Arimaa – CR12 : Wednesday, December, 3rd 
Presents : Everyone, Morgane with Christian Raymond and Nikos Parlavantzas
##Order of business :
1. CAF

##Information :
- Next report in two weeks, first draft in one week
- The plan is available in the Git
- In the future, we will emphasize more the application project of Gabriel and talk less about the MCTS test until the next report will be done
- Report length : around 10 pages
- TODO : find all tasks and add them, and find out the workload of each of them. The workload will be defined by the Poker method, explained in the report (each one guess separately the workload and we take as a result the more repetitive answer). We work that way to avoid other's influence to determine workloads, and to make it possible to have the more complete tasks list.
- Do not do all the tests at the end
- Base our work on the basis prototype, test, conclusions, other prototype to the final version
- Add the number of people working in the workload
- See what Thierry Roger (Project teacher) can do, change the topic of his practical if possible to work on his project
- Risk analysis : what could go wrong in our planning
