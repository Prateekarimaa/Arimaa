This project is about inducing artificial intelligence for board games using”Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm“ and is coined as “Fast \& Furious Game Playing ,Monte Carlo Drift”. The choice of board game for this project is “Arimaa”.
\newline
\newline
“Arima“ was conceived and developed by Umar Syed, a computer science engineer in 2003.Till now the game is played between two human players and this time it is developed with artificial intelligent program that will play against a human player .The first program that can beat a human player in a game of 6 or more matches is entitled to win a prize of 10000 USD, by Umar Syed.
\newline
\newline
A revolution in scheduling algorithms originated in “MCTS-Monte Carlo Tree search Algorithm” .So, the techniques of MCTS algorithm are utilized in this project to find the best move. MCTS is a heuristic search algorithm of making decisions in some decision process. It concentrates on analysing the optimum moves by expansion of the search tree on random sampling of the search space.
\newline
\newline
The program will be implemented using one of the parallelisation techniques that best suits the environment. Using parallelisation the program can be executed on different systems simultaneously .The program will be executed on grid 5000, a cluster of multi core machines.

The game is going to be lot more interesting and will be a tough competition with this artificial intelligent program being induced in Arimaa.
